# XinChang BitElement

The idea of this project is to explore the city of XinChang. However this concept could be applied to any location. 

# BitElement - the 6Th Element of Xinchang
Xinchang has a long and varied history. First starting as a salt mining town a thousand three hundred years ago. Then turning to a market town for trade. After that poets occupied the village and now it’s becoming an artist village. The whole time xinchang has managed to maintain its history and heritage without loosing its identity. It even has its own dialect. Being close to one of the worlds fastest growing mega cities, shanghai, but being just far enough away that its not effected by redevelopment and gentrification, has allowed it to maintain its cultural significance. 

Chinese zodiacs believe in five fundamental elements that make up a chart. Water, wood, earth, fire and metal. These elements all have different properties and characteristics. According to Chinese mythology these characteristics dictate your personality. For instance a person who is born in the year when water is in the chart will be flexible and easily shaped yet turbulent as opposed to metal which would make that person strong and firm, they can be shaped but only with effort.

The elements have other meanings too. In cartography they represent the north south east west and centre of a region.

This artwork explores these elements and their relation to each other and in particular the creative mind. The work tries to emulate each element in a geolocation based WebVR experience.

This work proposes a 6th element that has become essential to modern life, the digital bit element (byte) which is unique to you. Its your digital signature. This element is a combination of all other elements. As the Chinese zodiac chart has already existed for years and can’t be modified this platform allows you to create your own bitelement based on your personal info and activity with the artwork as an extension to the chart.

You the visitor is invited to explore the north south east west and central XinChang old village with a map and some VR goggles. On the map the 5 elements are marked and your invited to explore them. When you discover an element it unlocks a characteristic and logs your activity into your profile. When you return to base your able to generate your own unique element. 

This work explores that unique element that represents you. Its your XinChang BitElement.

# Master scene
Desaturated ambient occlusion. All white to show the elements. When you find an element the scene reveals that element. The longer you stay the richer that element. For example if I like what’re I will stay there for a long time and make the colour as rich as possible. If I dislike fire then when I find that element I will not spend as much time there and nmaybe not see its full richness. I may even skip or miss an element.

### BitElement Gallery
How to see your elelment. In the eral world back at the main gallery a screen would showcase all ButElements created. But in the virtual world you can visit your element in a digital gallery.

### Questions 
Element sounds. If water was a sound how would it sound?
When they leave what do they see?

## Conclusion
Come to XinChang Pudong China to Mine BitElements.
